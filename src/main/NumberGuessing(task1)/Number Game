#############################-----Number Game-----#############################
The Random class is used to generate a random number within the specified range.

The game starts with a loop that allows the user to play multiple rounds. The loop continues as long as the user wants to play again.

In each round, a random target number is generated. The user is prompted to input their guess.

The user's guess is compared with the target number, and appropriate feedback is given. If the guess is correct, the user's score is 
incremented, and the loop breaks.

The user has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number, and the remaining attempts are displayed after each incorrect guess.

After each round, the user is asked if they want to play again. The loop continues or terminates based on their response.

At the end of the game, the user's final score is displayed based on the number of rounds won.
