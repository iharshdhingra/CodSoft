#############################-----Word Counter-----#############################

The program starts by prompting the user to choose between entering text manually or providing a file path.

If the user chooses to enter text manually, the program reads the input text and stores it in the text variable. If the user chooses to provide a file, the program reads the content of the file and stores it in the text variable.

The text is split into an array of words using a regular expression that considers spaces and common punctuation marks as delimiters.

A loop iterates through the array of words, incrementing the wordCount variable for each non-empty word encountered.

The total count of words is displayed to the user.

This program provides a simple word counting functionality. To further enhance the project, you can consider implementing features like
ignoring common words (stop words), providing statistics on unique words or word frequency, handling empty inputs or file errors, and 
creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more user-friendly experience.
